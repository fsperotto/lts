## Semantic Text Segmentation with Embeddings

  https://github.com/ReemHal/Semantic-Text-Segmentation-with-Embeddings/

Given a text document *d* and a desired number of segments *k*, 
this repo shows how to segment the document into *k* semantically homoginuous segments. 

The general approach is as follows:
1. Convert the words in *d* into embedding vectors using the GloVe model.
2. For all word sequences *s* in *d*: the average meaning (centroid) of *s* is represented by taking the average embeddings of all words in *s*.
3. The error in the centroid calculation for a sequence *s* is calculated as the average cosine distance between the centroid and all words in *s*.
4. The segmentation is done using the greedy heuristic by iteratively choosing the best split point *p*.


The class text_segmentation_class in __[text_segmetnation.py](https://github.com/ReemHal/Semantic-Text-Segmentation-with-Embeddings/blob/master/text_segmentation.py)__ contains funtions to convert the document
words in GloVe embeddings and choose the splitting points. The notebook __[semantc_text_segmentation_example.ipynb](https://github.com/ReemHal/Semantic-Text-Segmentation-with-Embeddings/blob/master/semantc_text_segmentation_example.ipynb)__
demonstrates how to use the class.
