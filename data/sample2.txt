Hypertension affects 1–5% of children and adolescents, and the incidence has been increasing in association with obesity.
 However, secondary causes of hypertension such as renal parenchymal diseases, congenital abnormalities and renovascular
 disorders still remain the leading cause of pediatric hypertension, particularly in children under 12 years old. 
Other less common causes of hypertension in children and adolescents, including immobilization, burns, illicit and prescription drugs, dietary 
supplements, genetic disorders, and tumors will be addressed in this review

Despite a recent increase in the diagnosis of pediatric hypertension due to the proliferation of obesity, 
hypertension is relatively uncommon in the pediatric age group, affecting 1–5% of children. In contrast to adults,
 hypertension in children is usually secondary to an identifiable etiology, with the most common cause being renal disease.
 When evaluating a pediatric patient for hypertension, it is reasonable to first consider the common etiologies such as renal
 parenchymal diseases, congenital abnormalities, and renovascular disorders. However, a number of uncommon processes can also
 cause hypertension in the pediatric population. Each of these etiologies is rare in and of itself, and the number of patients
 with “unusual” causes will comprise less than 5% of all patients with secondary hypertension. This review focuses on select unusual
 etiologies (Table 1). Often, careful history and consideration of the context or the presentation of hypertension may be important
 clues to the diagnosis in these less frequent processes.
